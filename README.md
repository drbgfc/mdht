Model-Driven Health Tools (MDHT)
======
Open Health Tools Model-Driven Health Tools (**MDHT**) Project is a wide-ranging open source effort to promote interoperability in healthcare infrastructure. It promotes shared artifacts between related healthcare standards and standards development organizations, and works to develop localized specifications. It also delivers a common modeling framework and tools that support seamless integration of design, publication, and runtime artifact creation.

## Download
### Release
These are the stable releases recommended for production work.

If you've already got Eclipse installed, add the update site (http://oht-modeling.sourceforge.net/updates/releases20) and install **MDHT CDA Design**.

Otherwise, you can download pre-packaged Eclipse versions from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oht-modeling/files/Releases/Products/):
* The Designer version is for users interested in modeling CDA Implementation guides (if you don't know what to pick, pick this)
* The Developer version is for users interested in developing applications using the MDHT Java API
* The Analyst version is for users interested in validating and viewing CDA document instances

### Nightly
These are occasional nightly builds (manual-triggered) with the latest code of MDHT. This is not recommended for production work.

If you've already got Eclipse installed, add the update site (http://oht-modeling.sourceforge.net/updates/nightly) and install **MDHT CDA Design**.

Otherwise, you can download a pre-packaged Eclipse version from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oht-modeling/files/Nightly%20Builds/Products/cda.design.site/) - this is the Designer version.
